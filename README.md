## Description
Jovani Games is presenting the first version of our project: a copy of the ideo game Sorcer Striker. Inspired by the original game, Jovani Games is working to recreate the gameplay, storyline, and immersive world of Sorcer Striker.

It is an action-fantasy game where players take on the role of powerful sorcerers who must defend the realm against hordes of dark creatures. As a sorcerer, you will unleash devastating spells, summon magical creatures, and explore mystical realms in an epic quest to restore peace.
