## Description
Jovani Games is presenting the pre-alpha version of our project: a copy of the ideo game Sorcer Striker. Inspired by the original game, Jovani Games is working to recreate the gameplay, storyline, and immersive world of Sorcer Striker.

It is an action-fantasy game where players take on the role of powerful sorcerers who must defend the realm against hordes of dark creatures. As a sorcerer, you will unleash devastating spells, summon magical creatures, and explore mystical realms in an epic quest to restore peace.

## How to Play
1. **Controls**
   - Movement: Use WASD to move your character.
   - Attack: Press the Spacebar for the basic attack.
   - Special Abilities: Press X to deploy a bomb.

2. **Objective**
   - Defeat Enemies: Engage in fast-paced battles with various types of dark creatures. Aim your spells accurately and use your special abilities wisely to defeat them.
   - Complete Quests: Accept quests from NPCs throughout the realm. Follow the quest markers and accomplish objectives to progress in the game.
   - Upgrade and Customize: Collect magical items and earn experience points to level up your sorcerer. Unlock powerful spells, enhance your abilities, and customize your character's appearance.
